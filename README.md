# Amazon-Scrapper
Scrapper using node js



** For example, you can send a GET request to http://localhost:3000/scrape?api_key=YOUR_SCRAPER_API_KEY&keyword=Electronics&page=2 to scrape the Amazon search results for "Electronics" on page 2 using the provided Scraper API key.

Similarly, you can use the /scrape-external endpoint by passing the URL to scrape as a query parameter (url) and the Scraper API key as api_key in the URL.

Make sure to replace 'YOUR_SCRAPER_API_KEY' with your actual Scraper API key.**
